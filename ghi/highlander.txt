                  Forge me a sword, and I want you to try
               To sharpen it well when you're done.
            For I learned yesterday that I cannot die,
               And they say THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!

               Forge me a sword, for I need to defend
               Against those who'll come seeking my head.
               And we'll fight 'till the inescapable end,
               That leaves one alive, and one dead.
	
            Forge me a sword, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!,
            And too much time already has passed.
            For though we all must fall, ere the Game can be done,
            I'll be damned if I won't be the last.
	
                I am Highlander, the IMMORTAL.
                From the depths of time, I and many of my
                kind have battled and loved. We are waiting
                for the time of the Gathering, when only a
                few of us are left. Then we will battle for
                the ULTIMATE prize.
	
                   Remember THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!
